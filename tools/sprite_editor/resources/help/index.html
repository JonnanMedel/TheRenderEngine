   <b><i>The Render Engine</i> - Sprite Editor</b><br/>
   &copy; 2011 - Brett Fattori  [MIT Licensed]
   <p>
      The Sprite Editor in <i>The Render Engine</i> is intended to assist you in creating
      your own sprite sheets for use in your games.  It allows you to create any number of
      animations, each containing any number of frames.  You can have a different block size
      for each animation, from 8x8 to 64x64.  You can export your sprites to a "sprite sheet"
      which makes importing them into <i>The Render Engine</i>, using the <tt>SpriteLoader</tt>, much
      easier.
   </p>
   <p>
      The editor's goal is not to replace tools like Photoshop&trade; or Gimp, but is instead
      aimed at being a simple way to organize sprites into animations while still providing basic
      editing tools found in those applications.  The editor is also well suited to creating tiles
      for tile mapped games.
